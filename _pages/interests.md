Iâ€™m fascinated by all aspects of astronomy, especially those related to habitability. The origin of life is a significant unknown, and our future as humans is deeply connected to our understanding of other planetary bodies.

Stellar Evolution: I am curious about the life cycles of stars and the processes that create the elements essential for life. I want to understand the mechanisms of stellar birth, evolution, and death.

Extreme Environmental Astrophysics: I am drawn to the study of extreme conditions in the universe and the associated high-energy phenomena, such as various accretion disc outbursts.

Exoplanets: I am interested in the methods used to find exoplanets, determining their various properties, and characterizing these distant worlds to understand their atmospheres and potential for habitability.

Astrobiology: Everything comes down to this- I am intrigued by the search for life beyond Earth. Exploring the origins of life, what are the necessary conditions that make a world habitable? and the potential existence of extraterrestrial organisms or intelligence.
