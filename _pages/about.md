Hello! I’m Aman, and I’m currently pursuing a degree in Astrophysics. This site will serve as a portfolio to document my journey as a student, including my progress, various projects, research and achievements.

Throughout this journey, I want to delve deeper into the details of stars, galaxies, and exoplanets. I am particularly interested in the habitability of exoplanets. I want to learn about the specific tools, both software and hardware, that aid in discovering and studying these fascinating celestial bodies.

Thank you for visiting my portfolio. I hope you find my work and journey interesting!

I have always been fascinated by stars and exoplanets, inspired by science fiction books and movies. Who isn’t? However, I did not know how to pursue this passion academically or if it could be a career. Instead, I became a baker and joined the hospitality/retail industry, working in a very remote area of Perth. With no other entertainment or activities available, I discovered the Open University, UK and took a broad introductory science course. I was so captivated by it that I ended up pursuing a part-time honours degree in Astronomy and Planetary Science.

After COVID-19, I started a Master’s in Astrophysics at the University of Southern Queensland. Initially, I wasn’t looking for a job in the field; I began studying purely out of boredom. However, my interest has grown, and now I am eager to see where this path leads me.
